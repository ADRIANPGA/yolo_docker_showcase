Comparison with Other Detection Methods:
Compare YOLO’s approach with that of region-based methods like R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and SSD. This can help students appreciate YOLO’s speed–accuracy balance and understand its limitations (e.g., in localizing small objects).

Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning:
Discuss how pre-trained models are adapted to new datasets, emphasizing the importance of transfer learning in speeding up training and improving performance in YOLO implementations.

Real-World Challenges and Ethical Considerations:
Explore the challenges of deploying object detection systems (e.g., trade-offs between speed and accuracy, small object detection issues, and hardware constraints). Also, briefly discuss data bias and ethical considerations in training and deploying such systems.

Future Trends in Object Detection:
Introduce emerging ideas like transformer-based detectors, self-supervised learning approaches, and the potential of YOLO-NAS or other neural architecture search methods to inspire further innovation.
